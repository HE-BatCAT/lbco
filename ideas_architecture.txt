Architecture/design ideas:

Motivation and main requirements:
Create a lightweight ontology to describe digital twins of battery manufacturing.
Address BatCAT requirements (D4.1) and connect to BattINFO, BVCO, MODA, CHADA.

Expressivity level: OWL dialect, with as much expressivity as needed. Start low (ALC+Transitivity (*)), increase as per explicit substantiated needs.
(*) Transitivity is needed to exploit parthood.

Naming convention:
- snake_case
-- Individuals: all upper case
-- Classes: all lower case
-- Properties: all lower case
- Singular nouns. Properties given as verbs, third person.

Splitting in modules and files:
- Modules should be usable on their own, or at most require upper ones 
- Decide on prefixes/namespaces: same prefix used for all modules (lbco)

Versioning convention:
- Versioning of modules/whole set: the whole set and its releases are versioned by date (year-month), whereas each module using X.X.X notation.
- (Should) Use clear and semantic versioning 

Alignment to TLOs:
- It is done in a separate "alignment" module(s)
- Decide on hard vs soft alignment: currently alignments are hard ones (subclassing and equivalence)

Reuse:
- Reuse/connect to existing ontologies/vocabularies etc wherever possible
-- E.g., beside ontologies, also ISO/IEC standards (cf. Clark et al paper on BattINFO)

Openness:
- Our results will be open, and do not impose dependencies on non-open standards 

Good practices:
- Use OOPS! and FOOPS! to check implementation
- Make the repository public as soon as reasonable
- (Should) Connect to LOV
- (Could) Use MOD Ontology to describe and publish the ontologies themselves (https://www.isibang.ac.in/ns/mod/index.html)

SKOS/RDF for dropdowns:
- (Should) For dropdowns, make the needed concepts implementation friendly. For example, in case of flat lists, provide SKOKS lists (even if this implies duplication of RDF classes).
 Or define clear SPARQL queries to identify the elements clearly. Evaluate need for nested dropdowns.
