Architecture/design ideas:

Motivation and main requirements:
Create a lightweight ontology to describe digital twins of battery manufacturing.
Address BatCAT requirements (D4.1) and connect to BattINFO, BVCO, MODA, CHADA.

Expressivity level: OWL dialect, with as much expressivity as needed. Start low (ALC+Transitivity (*)), increase as per explicit substantiated needs.
(*) Transitivity is needed to exploit parthood.

Naming convention:
- CamelCase or snake_case? -> snake_case
-- Individuals: all upper case
-- Classes: all lower case
-- Properties: all lower case
- Singular nouns. Properties given as verbs, third person.

Splitting in modules and files:
- Modules should be usable on their own, or at most require an upper one 
- Decide on prefixes/namespaces (same for all modules or not?) (TBD)

Versioning convention:
- Use clear and semantic versioning (TBD)
- Versioning of modules/whole set : define how do they relate to each other (TBD)

Alignment to TLOs:
- It is done in a separate "alignment" module(s)
- Decide on hard vs soft alignment (TBD)

Reuse:
- Reuse/connect to existing ontologies/vocabularies etc wherever possible
-- E.g., for missing terms in BattINFO, cf. ISO/IEC standards (cf. Clark et al paper on BattINFO)

Openness:
- Our results will be open, and do not impose dependencies on non-open standards - NB: Issue with connections to ISO/IEC 

Good practices:
- Use OOPS! to check implementation
- Make the repositiory public as soon as reasonable, connect to LOV
- (Could) Use MOD Ontology to describe and publish the ontologies themselves (https://www.isibang.ac.in/ns/mod/index.html)

SKOS/RDF for dropdowns:
- For dropdowns, make the needed concepts implementation friendly. For example, in case of flat lists, provide SKOKS lists (even if this implies duplication of RDF classes).
 Or define clear SPARQL queries to identify the elements clearly. Evaluate need for nested dropdowns.
